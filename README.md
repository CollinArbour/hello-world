## What is GitHub?
Git is a version control software, that keeps a history of your edits on files you store in it. GitHub is a webservice that uses Git software to make team collaboration on coding projects easier. Your repositories of software code are stored on line and people can see it, pull it for themselves, branch it to make their own edits and troubleshoot, and can then request to merge with the original repository to publish the new edits.
